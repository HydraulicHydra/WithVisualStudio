# WithVisualStudio
First of two Azure Tests.
I followed all the steps and I'm not even sure if this is supposed to be everything for the first step.
I tried to do the second half with the command line, I rreally tried.  I worked at it for hours on end but both
the Azure command prompt and my own command prompt returned error after error.  I downloaded git, I made sure my
Azure account was logged in and properly set up, but it won't publish.  No matter what I do I can't get anything
sent to Git.Hub from my command line, I get nothing but errors.  I'm really trying, I swear, but it's not working
at all, no matter wahat I do.
