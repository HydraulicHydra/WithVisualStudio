# WithVisualStudio
Here is my completed HW2, titled MvcMovie, as instructed by the tutorial.
It runs totally fine in Visual Studio, but GitHub is still total nonsense
and refuses to let me just upload to a new repository, so I cleared this
one out and uploaded everything important to it.  I have no idea what I'm
expected to do if GitHub is refusing to let me just make a new directory
and upload the entire project to it, so I'm making do.
